# TwinkieNSIS
NSIS source code for the Twinkie installer, requires having a `TwinkieModloader.dll`, `LICENSE.txt`, `Twinkie.ttf` (which is Cascadia Mono, subject to the SIL Open Font License Version 1.1), and `description.yaml` files, you can get the DLL from the Twinkie releases or by compiling the project yourself.
